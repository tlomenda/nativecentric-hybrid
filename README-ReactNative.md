# HelloApp Demo: React Native
This README provides details on using React Native and setting up the *HelloAppReact* demo app to run on your workstation.

##Demo Setup
React Native requires HomeBrew, Node, Watchman, and Flow to work.  Follow these [setup instructions](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) to get started.

The demo code is located at [./demo/HelloAppReactNative](./demo/HelloAppReactNative).

###Package Dependencies
* **Node** ([https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)).  JavaScript runtime that also provides a package manager (npm) for many JavaScript libraries and packages.
* **Watchman** ([GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/watchman)).  Watches files and triggers actions when they change.
* **Flow** ([GitHub](https://github.com/dreamerslab/node.flow)).  A deadly simple flow control package for node.js.

###Installing React Native CLI
```
$ npm install -g react-native-cli
```

This will install the newest release of React Native.  At the time of writing the following versions were installed:

```
react-native-cli: 1.0.0
react-native: 0.23.1
```

###IDE Dev Tools
* Xcode 7.3 or Higher
* Android 
	* Android SDK
	
	```
	$ brew install android-sdk
	``` 	
	* Android Studio 2.0 or Higher.
* **Atom** ([https://atom.io/](https://atom.io/)) with atom-react Package.  Great tool for React JSX development.

```
$ apm install react
```  

## Running the Demo App
From the command-line, make sure you are in the *./demo/HelloAppReactNative* directory.

```
$ npm install
$ cd ./ios
$ pod install
```

* Running on iOS
	* Open *HelloAppReact.xcworkspace* in the ./demo/HelloAppReactNative/ios directory on Xcode
	* Run in the iOS emulator

* Run on Android	
	* Import ./demo/HelloAppReactNative/android as a Gradle project in *Android Studio*
	* Run in the Android Emulator 

##Key Selling Points
* Ability to render using the platform's standard rendering APIs (eg: UIKit on iOS).

* React Native also has the potential to positively impact your product release cycle. For instance, Apple permits JavaScript-based changes to an appâ€™s behavior to be loaded over the air with no additional review cycle necessary.

* Native Bridge to Render to native platform

* JSX Combines JavaScript and Markup in one file (separation of concerns NOT technology).

* Relies on CSS Flexbox for Layout

* Allows CSS consistent support of styling rules.  Unlike the web where CSS support varies across browsers.

* React Native for iOS and Android includes support for many of the commonly used features, and React Native can support any asynchronous native API

##Opiniated Views

* Styled Components (inherited) OVER reuse of styles
* Uses Component-based approach.  If ever in doubt, create a component.
* For custom touch, PanResponder is almost always preferred over GestureResponder.

##Components for Mobile (notes)
* Supporting Touch through TouchableHighlight, PanResponder, and GestureResponder
	* Touch:  *start, move, release*
	*  Using *spread syntax* to add a panResponder to a view
*  Basic Flow Control Components (TabView, NavigatorView, ListView)
	*
